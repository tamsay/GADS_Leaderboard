# Leaderboard

[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/40dc40d4-59df-46b4-beec-3d3febd11a76/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/wizardly-bassi-8d563d/deploys)

The leaderboard project is my entry in one of the HNG7 internship task. It was created using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap and Vanilla Javascript. 

The data being used to populate the leaderboard is gotten from a JSON object in the script file and it can be easily modified to fetch data from an API as well. The screenshot of the desktop and mobile views are shown below.
