# GADS Leaderboard

[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/0ec2079a-f69c-4e1c-8144-35c5d33d11a1/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/naughty-engelbart-6220f2/deploys)

This leaderboard project is a modification of the existing leaderboard on the GADS website. The changes made are listed below
- Adding a profile picture to the top three scores
- Making the leaderboard table responsive on all screens
- Adding a sidebar navigation for the main categories on large screens and horizontal top navigation for smaller screens
- Animating the leader cards

The leaderboard table data was created via javascript and the data was gotten from a JSON object locally created in the script file. It can be easily modified to fetch data from an API also.
